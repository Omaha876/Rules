Hello, and welcome to the Unofficial Micro Center Discord! A community where we share our passion for technology and help one another obtain and sometimes troubleshoot the tech we love.
 
During the onboarding process, you'll have an opportunity to select what server aspects you're interested in, which Micro Center store location(s) you'd like to see, and optionally, if you'd like to elect any pronouns to your profile. If you'd like to adjust these, use the Channels & Roles button at the top of the channel list to adjust your selections.

We have a leveling system here, provided by Mee6, that encourages chatting in channels by providing rewards at certain milestone levels. The <#954038539400650782> channel has details on how this works and how to check your level.
 
Here's a brief description of the channel categories that are in the server:
```ini
[GENERAL] - General chat channels, like public chat and server questions.
```
```ini
[TECHNOLOGY] - Technology related chat channels, like benchmarks, troubleshooting, gaming, pc build advice, etc.
```
```ini
[OFF-TOPIC] - Non-technology related chat channels, like cars and food.
```
```ini
[MARKETPLACE] - selling and trading posts, divided up into geographic store regions. Active Member status ("Green" / Mee6 Level 10) required to list items in the marketplace. 
```
Marketplace has its own set of rules in <#892606881581899826>.

We hope that you have a fun and joyful experience in our server!
