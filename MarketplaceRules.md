[Marketplace Rules] 
```
`Updated 1/1/2022`

**Users must be __LEVEL 10__ to POST in the marketplace.** The marketplace is a privilege for active members. This is to protect you from scammers and exploitation of the marketplace. You can check your level by typing \rank in <#809956837062737960>

*First, some things to define:*

**Receipt Value** or **MSRP** - The amount of money paid for your item from a retailer **BEFORE TAX OR OTHER COSTS.** If this is a restricted product, and a user is unable to provide a receipt from an __authorized__ retailer, we will base it off **the current price from Micro Center**. If not available from Micro Center, staff will use their best judgement from other retailers.

**(At) Cost** - Cost is the receipt value, plus applicable real, direct costs, such as tax paid, shipping charges paid, and the cost of a Micro Center transferrable warranty, if included.

**Full system build** - A computer containing all of the necessary parts to function, minus peripherals (mouse, keyboard, monitor). A full build will have a case, power supply, motherboard, CPU, memory, discrete modern GPU, disk. To reiterate, **to be considered a full system build, the build must contain a discrete GPU currently being manufactured and sold,** such as Nvidia RTX 3000 and 2600 series, AMD RX 6000 series, and Nvidia GTX 1600 series; excluding GT 710.

**Marketplace regions** - Marketplace regions have been defined based on store location cluster; the national channel will still be maintained. Below is how the stores have been organized by region:
    National - all stores
    West - Tustin, CA
    Mountain - Denver, CO
    Midwest - St. Louis Park, MN; Overland Park, KS; Brentwood, MO; Westmont and Chicago, IL; Madison Heights, MI; Sharonville, Columbus, and Mayfield Heights, OH
    Texas - Houston and Dallas
    Georgia - Duluth and Marietta
    Northeast - North Jersey, NJ; Westbury, Yonkers, Flushing, and Brooklyn, NY; Cambridge, MA
    DMV - Fairfax, VA; Rockville and Parkville, MD;  St. Davids, PA

Please post to the region that contains the Micro Center store closest to you. Cross-posting to National with willingness to ship is always allowed.

*Now onto the rules:*

1. **NO SCALPING!**
You may list your item at its **cost** +$50 of profit. If the item is a full system build (see definition above), you may list it at its **cost** +$150 of profit.

This profit can be used to recoup gas, fufill a finders fee, cover your time and labor, whatever. It does not need to be justified, it just needs to be $50 ($150 for full system builds) or less.
```diff
As a reminder, application of this rule extends beyond this marketplace; it includes your selling and trading activity outside of this server.
```
**All transactions must follow this rule, including trade deals *on both ends*.**
In regards to undervaluing, staff will use discretion to determine if the user is exploiting the marketplace. Please review the term "Receipt Value" above.

**Violations**
In most instances, **scalping will result in ban.** Users will not be punished for human error, though, the revised caps and math requirement should minimize this. As stated previously, restricted products will be of higher scrutiny. Please review the scalping policy as stated in <#892488347036041267>.

2. **Marketplace channels are limited to listings only.** Discussions and commentary about listings are not allowed within marketplace channels; your DMs should be open if you're expecting to negotiate for your marketplace listing.

3. **All marketplace-related offerings must be listed in the marketplace.** This prevents those below Level 10 (Active Member / "Green") from offering items for sale ad-hoc in other channels of the server. You may link to your marketplace-listed offering in chat channels, but you may not outright offer to sell or trade items on this server outside of the marketplace.

4. **Marketplace is intended for hardware only.** We intend for computer components, peripherals, and other DIY-related content to be posted in the marketplace. There is some leeway with this, since hardware is loosely defined, but obscure or unrelated content will be removed, such as couches.

5. **Listings need to show math.** You must include the breakdown of costs used to calculate your listing price somewhere in your listing. Staff may request receipts for verification.

6. **Please follow H-W-L format.** H - have, W - want, L - location, (optional) N - notes , in that order. Example:
```
[H] EVGA 3080 FTW3 Ultra (paid $1035 with tax)
[W] $1085 ($1035 + $50)
[L] Columbus, Ohio
[N] Notes (optional)
```
Notes can be used to indicate willingness to ship,

7. **All listings require a timestamp.** You must take a picture of the item with your username and date somewhere in the image. It cannot be digitally added to a picture (i.e. photoshopped); must be either handwritten or displayed on a digital device in the photo, like a tablet or phone.

8. **All items in listings must be IN HAND.** No posting pictures of a Newegg win prior to buying or receiving it. Have the item in hand, follow the rule above, then post.

9. **All selling listings require an asking price.** 

10. **Want-to-buy requests are not allowed.** They are considered spam, and they attract scalpers.

11. **You may repost your listing once every few days, at most 3 times.** If it doesn't sell, it doesn't sell.

12. **You cannot ask the buyer to cover transactions fees when using PayPal G&S.** This is against PayPal's terms of use. You may instead offer a discount for local transactions.

13. **If you are shipping something, emphasize who covers those costs during negotiation.** On other platforms such as HWS, when the listing price covers shipping, they say "$(dollar amount) shipped". Else, emphasize that shipping costs are separate.

14.  **Do not delete completed listings** If you have sold or traded your item, please edit the listing with ~~strikeout~~, and add **SOLD** or **TRADED**, but do not delete. If you wish to withdraw your unfilfilled listing entirely, then it is OK to delete.

[Notes]
```
**We take the marketplace seriously.** It is one of the most controversial concepts for a Discord server, especially when we enforce a no-scalping policy. As such, understand that every action comes with discussion amongst the staff members.

**Be smart about what you do online.** We do everything we can to prevent scamming or exploitation, but we are not perfect. Please use caution, and report suspicious behavior to <@575252669443211264>.

**It may be wise to write your listing in Notepad prior to submission.**

**Keep your listing to the point.** Add notes that you feel are relevant, but don't make it spammy.

**Marketplace is a privilege.** As stated before, the marketplace is controversial. We want to make user experience fantastic - if we feel that the marketplace has become toxic or manipulated, we will remove it.


**By reacting :white_check_mark:, you agree to these rules. You also agree to the rules of other marketplaces, when applicable.**
