`Updated 1/1/2022`

**Users must be __LEVEL 10__ to POST in the marketplace.** This is to protect buyers from scammers. You can check your level by typing \rank in <#809956837062737960>.

*First, some things to define:*

**Base Value** -
__Purchased from an authorized retailer:__ the amount of money paid for your item on a receipt after any discounts, but before taxes and other costs.
__Purchased from a private party sale or non-authorized retailer:__ the lowest value between these sources shall be used: the actual item sale price (before tax and other costs), MSRP, or the current item pricing from an authorized retailer.

**(At) Cost** - Cost is the base value, plus applicable real, direct costs, such as tax paid, shipping charges paid, and the cost of a Micro Center transferrable warranty, if applicable.

**Full system build** - A PC containing all of the necessary parts to function, minus peripherals (mouse, keyboard, monitor). A full build shall be assembled with a case, power supply, motherboard, CPU, memory, disk, and modern discrete GPU. To reiterate, **to be considered a full system build, the build must contain a discrete GPU currently being manufactured and sold,** such as Nvidia RTX 3000 and 2600 series, AMD RX 6000 series, and Nvidia GTX 1600 series. This discourages those shucking GPUs out of good builds and reselling here.

**Marketplace regions** - Regions are based on Micro Center store location clusters, plus a National channel for shipped items. Below is how the stores have been grouped:
    * National - all stores
    * West - Tustin, CA
    * Mountain - Denver, CO
    * Midwest - St. Louis Park, MN; Overland Park, KS; Brentwood, MO; Westmont and Chicago, IL; Madison Heights, MI; Sharonville, Columbus, and Mayfield Heights, OH
    * Texas - Houston and Dallas
    * Georgia - Duluth and Marietta
    * DMV - Fairfax, VA; Rockville and Parkville, MD;  St. Davids, PA
    * Northeast - North Jersey, NJ; Westbury, Yonkers, Flushing, and Brooklyn, NY; Cambridge, MA

Your listing should be posted to the region that contains the Micro Center store closed to you. If you're willing to sell and ship domestically to a buyer using PayPal G&S, then you may cross-post to National.

*Now onto the rules:*

1. **NO SCALPING OR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EXTREME MARKET DEMAND.**
You may list your item at its **cost** +$50 of profit. If item qualifies as a full system build as defined above, you may list it at its **cost** +$200 of profit.

This profit can be used to recoup gas, fufill a finders fee, cover your time and labor (especially for full system builds), etc. - it does not need to be justified or detailed, just included in your cost breakdown (see below).

**You must include a breakdown of actual costs paid; this shows buyers how you calculated your listing price.** All potential buyers should request receipts from sellers. See [Listing Rules] for information on how to show these in your listing.

**All transactions must follow this rule, including trade deals *on both ends*.**
```diff
As a reminder, application of this rule extends beyond this marketplace; it includes your selling and trading activity outside of this server, such as on Reddit HWS and FB Marketplace.
```
**Deliberate scalping here or elsewhere will result in ban.**

2. **Marketplace channels are limited to listings only.** Discussions and commentary about listings are not allowed within marketplace channels; your DMs should be open if you're expecting to negotiate for your marketplace listing.

3. **Any offer to sell or trade hardware must be listed in the marketplace.** This prevents those below Level 10 ("Active Member" / Green) from offering items for sale ad-hoc in other channels of the server. You may link to your marketplace-listed offering in chat channels, but you may not outright offer to sell or trade items on this server outside of the marketplace.

**Please follow H-W-L-N format.** H - have, W - want, L - location, N - notes , in that order. Example:
```
[H] New EVGA 3080 FTW3 Ultra (paid $1035 with tax)
[W] $1085 ($1035 + $50)
[L] Columbus, Ohio
[N] Notes
```
Notes may be used to indicate any additional information about your listing.

4. **Marketplace is intended for hardware only.** We intend for computer components, peripherals, and other DIY-related content to be posted in the marketplace. There is some leeway with this, since hardware is loosely defined, but obscure or unrelated content will be removed, such as couches.

5. **All listings require a timestamp.** You must take a picture of the item with your username and date somewhere in the image. It cannot be digitally added to a picture (i.e. photoshopped); must be either handwritten or displayed on a digital device in the photo, like a tablet or phone.

6. **All items in listings must be physically in hand.** No posting pictures of a Newegg win prior to buying or receiving it. Have the item in hand, then post.

7. **All selling listings require an asking price.**

8. **Want-to-buy requests are not allowed.** WTB listings encourage scalpers.

9. **When using PayPal G&S, you cannot ask a buyer to explicitly pay for transactions fees.** For sake of our marketplace, you may include those fees in your "Shipping & Handling" costs. Otherwise asking a buyer to pay transactions fees directly is against PayPal's terms of use.

10.  **Do not delete completed listings** If you have sold or traded your item, please edit the listing with ~~strikeout~~, and add **SOLD** or **TRADED**, but please do not delete. If you wish to withdraw your unfilfilled listing entirely, then it is OK to delete.

[Notes]
```
**We take the marketplace seriously.** It is one of the most controversial concepts for a Discord server, especially when we enforce a no-scalping policy. As such, understand that every action comes with discussion amongst the staff members.

**Be smart about what you do online.** We do everything we can to prevent scamming or exploitation, but we are not perfect. Please use caution, and report suspicious behavior to <@575252669443211264>.

**Marketplace is a privilege.** As stated before, the marketplace is controversial. We want to make user experience fantastic - if we feel that the marketplace has become toxic or manipulated, we will remove it.


**By reacting :white_check_mark:, you agree to these rules. You also agree to the rules of other marketplaces, when applicable.**
